# WatchPoint

Stop exactly where a variable gets changed (a.k.a. watchpoints or `trace_var` for all) and help you swim through (other people's) code faster.

According to [this page](http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/trouble.html) on ruby-doc.org there used to be watchpoints built into RDebug but I can't seem to find it in 1.9.3 and 2.0.0 on Mac. It turned out to be quite easy to roll your own so here goes.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'watch_point'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install watch_point
